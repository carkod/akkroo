## Installation

`npm i && npm start`

## Features

- State management with Redux
- Form control with React custom hooks
- Basic responsiveness (no specific device targeted, compatible with modern browsers-makes use of CSS grid which is partially supported by IE)
- Basic unit testing of components
- Integration with Akroo API mock


## Notes

- I took the liberty to swap process X and E. It didn't make much sense to me to "Thank" the user before attempting to save the data.
- Process B and C have been bundled into a single component as shown in the fictional library. But I would suggest breaking down into components for high reusability (text input, checkbox input, at least 2 components)
- Loader component has been created with just text, but it could easily be converted into a img, gif or svg spinner.
